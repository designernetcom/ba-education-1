                        The BA, short for Bachelor of Arts, is an undergraduate degree that can be pursued
                        by anyone who has completed high school (10+2) education. It takes about 3 years
                        to complete.
                    </p>
                    <p class="details">
                        In a BA program, you learn about a wide range of subjects like humanities, social
                        sciences, and liberal arts. This degree covers general education, optional courses,
                        and the main subjects aligned with the student's areas of interest. This helps
                        students understand the world better. It teaches them to think critically, solve
                        problems, and be creative.
                    </p>
                    <p class="details">


                        In India, BA is the most widely pursued undergraduate course, with over 10 million
                        students enrolled, constituting 35% of all undergraduates. BA degrees come in two
                        categories: General and Honours. The General program offers a broad range of
                        subjects for a well-rounded education, while the Honours program allows students to
